# Image Pixel Clustering using K-means
This project implements the K-means clustering algorithm to segment an image based on its pixel colors.

## Features
- **Read Image**: Load an image from a file.
- **K-means Clustering**: Cluster the image pixels into K clusters.
- **Output Image**: Generate a new image with pixels replaced by their cluster centroids.
